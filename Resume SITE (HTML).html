      <h2>Career Summary</h2>
      <p>
        I am the 19-year-old Co-Founder of India’s first AI-first software for Education and Learning environments,
        launched in March 2023. With a passion for technology and transformation, I specialize in automating workflows
        and simplifying AI adoption for institutions. Our first breakthrough came in June 2024 with our first client
        sale—an experience that revealed my strength in execution and implementation. Since then, I’ve grown as an
        early-stage entrepreneur, also beginning to explore sales and presentation. A proud moment was being recognized
        as AI Partners at the TiE Global Summit, one of India’s premier entrepreneurship conferences.
